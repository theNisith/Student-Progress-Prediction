# Student Progress Prediction

This project is a simple Python application that predicts student progress based on their credits and displays the results in a histogram using a graphical interface.

## Features

- Input student credits for pass, defer, and fail.
- Predict student progress based on the input credits.
- Display the results in a histogram using a graphical interface.
- Save the results to a file.
- Read and display the saved results from the file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-progress-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd student-progress-prediction
    ```
3. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.x is recommended).

## Usage

1. Run the `myProject.py` script:
    ```sh
    python myProject.py
    ```
2. Follow the prompts to input student credits.
3. The application will predict the student progress and display the results in a histogram.
4. The results will be saved to a file named `file.txt`.
5. You can read the saved results from the file and display them in the console.

## Dependencies

- `tkinter` (for the graphical interface)
